Through clear and accessible language, Gannon unpacks the wisdom of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, one of the oldest and most revered texts focused on the philosophy of yoga, and presents a sound and logical course leading to happiness, freedom and ultimately enlightenment.</p> <p> The Yoga Sutras say that the secret to our own happiness lies in our relationship with others and provides us with five ethical principles (ahimsa, satya, asteya, brahmacharya and aparigraha) to guide us in how we treat others. Ahimsa teaches us how to avoid personal suffering through not harming others, while satya reveals how telling the truth results in us being better listened to. Through asteya, or nonstealing, we learn the secret of wealth. Brahmacharya reveals how refraining from abusing others sexually is the key to health and vitality for ourselves, and finally, aparigraha opens our eyes to the ways in which greed holds us back from discovering our life’s purpose and destiny.</p> <p> Yoga and Veganism is a groundbreaking work that cleverly and convincingly demonstrates how these five guiding yogic principles, are tied to an ethical vegan lifestyle. Featuring an extensive Q&amp;A chapter as well as a selection of delicious recipes from the author along with personal essays from individuals whose lives have been transformed by veganism—including filmmaker Kip Andersen (Cowspiracy) and activist Ingrid Newkirk (president of PETA)—Yoga and Veganism provides a framework not just for yoga students and teachers but for anyone seriously looking to bring their lives into greater harmony with the Earth and to experience peace of mind, ease of heart, joy and happiness.</p> <p> <strong> Available in print, e-book, and audio book.</strong> </p> <h3> Sharon Gannon Reads From Yoga &#038; Veganism<br/> </h3> <h2> 1.

Along with David Life, she is the creator of the Jivamukti Yoga method, a path to enlightenment through compassion for all beings, which holds veganism as a core principle. Blessed by her teachers, Shri Brahmananda Sarasvati, Swami Nirmalananda, Sri K. Pattabhi Jois, Shyamdas, and Shri Milan Goswami, she is a pioneer in teaching yoga as spiritual activism. The Jivamukti method has been recognized as one of the nine forms of hatha yoga practiced in the world today. Gannon has authored many books and produced numerous yoga-related films and music albums. She resides in a wild forest sanctuary in upstate New York. For more information about the author, visit www. jivamuktiyoga.com and www.simplerecipesforjoy.com.</span> </p> <h2> In The Face Of The Current Global Health And Climate Crisis,</h2> <p> Yoga and Veganism is a poignant, timely exploration of these ideas at the intersection of physical health, the spiritual practice of yoga, and a harmonious existence with the planet and all beings. <span> </span> <h2> Press &#038; Praise For Yoga And Veganism<br/> </h2> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <p> <strong> “In Yoga and Veganism, Sharon Gannon radiates timeless wisdom and applies ancient truths to contemporary customs. She describes how yoga and a vegan diet can help heal our society’s ‘disease of disconnection’ and remedies a mind-set that has allowed cruelty and violence to become normalized on our troubled planet. I hope everybody will read Sharon’s book, which describes how our actions affect our world and how we can liberate ourselves through compassion to others.”</strong> </p> <p> —Gene Baur, founder of Farm Sanctuary </p> <p> <strong> “If we are to survive as a species, we need to improve our relationships with animals and nature; this book will show you how.”</strong> </p> <p> —Duncan Wong, founder of Yogic Arts </p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> “Reading Yoga and Veganism . . . I was enchanted, challenged, and moved. This beautiful book reminds us that loving-kindness is at the heart of yoga.”</strong> </p> <p> —Karen Dawn, founder of DawnWatch and author of Thanking the Monkey: Rethinking the Way We Treat Animals </p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> “Sharon’s mission of ahimsa is so deep and profound; she writes from her heart and soul.”</strong> </p> <p> —Gurmukh Kaur Khalsa, director of Golden Bridge Yoga </p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> “Sharon Gannon’s commitment to animal rights has been evident in every aspect of her life. She recognizes that the continued murder and slavery of animals affects all levels of consciousness, as well as our health, environment, and global famine, and that it will only be through individual shifts of mindfulness that this suffering can finally end. A modern, compassionate, and well-informed voice for Self-realization and planetary change, she has been unwavering in her quest to educate humankind that our animal brothers and sisters are experiencing a mass level of intolerable abuse that must be addressed if we believe in creating a world that is sustainable, harmonious, and peaceful for all. In her new book, Sharon uses the traditional text of Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras to draw our awareness to how our actions affect each other and the world we share. I highly recommend this informative book as an excellent resource to anyone interested in understanding yoga, its principles, and how these ancient teachings can impact all beings and species in these contemporary and complicated times.”</strong> </p> <p> —Seane Corn, yoga teacher, co-founder of Off the Mat, Into the World and author of Revolution of the Soul: Awaken to Love Through Raw Truth, Radical Healing, and Conscious Action </p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> “Sharon’s writing is born from her commitment to walking the talk. She is the living embodiment of the selflessness she teaches and has had a profound impact on my life as a musician and peace worker. She encourages me by her example to mean what I say and to say what I mean with each breath and with every smile.”</strong> </p> <p> —Michael Franti, musician, activist, and author of Food for the Masses: Lyrics &amp; Portraits </p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> “Sharon Gannon beautifully illustrates the perfect symbiosis of yoga and veganism. The most mindful, spiritual, soulful practice married to the most healthful, harmless, life-affirming diet—what could be more intuitive, more beneficial, and more necessary?”</strong> </p> <p> —Rory Freedman, co-author of the #1 New York Times best seller Skinny Bitch </p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> “A prayer as pledge, a practice opening compassion, a yoke that gives freedom, a strength that comes from kindness, a yoga book that reveals how beautifully liberating animal-free eating is.”</strong> </p> <p> —Carol J. Adams, author of The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory and co-author of Protest Kitchen: Fight Injustice, Save the Planet, and Fuel Your Resistance One Meal at a Time </p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> “The urgency of ahimsa and animal protection, especially when it comes to our own diets, is a very important component of spiritual life, and is often underestimated. Few have been as outspoken on this as Sharon Gannon, who has written a pioneering, groundbreaking work on this subject. It is innovative and important because through her insightful investigation of the yogic scriptures she has taken the subject to new depths, going beyond the common conception of ahimsa and showing how universal compassion manifests in satya, asteya, brahmacharya, and aparigraha as well. She also reveals the connection between asana and veganism—perhaps for the first time—and also how a compassionate vegan diet intersects with Patanjali’s kriya yoga (tapas, svadhyaya, and ishvarapranidhana). In other words, her book should be considered the guidebook on the yoga of action or modern-day spiritual activism. Indeed, she is to be applauded for her efforts on behalf of ourselves, the planet, and our four-footed, scaly, and feathered kin.”</strong> </p> <p> —Steven J. Rosen (Satyaraja Dasa), biographer, scholar, and author in the fields of philosophy, Indic religion, and comparative spirituality </p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> “Sarve Sukhino Bhavantu: “May all beings be happy.” This is the universal message of true spirituality. Compassion to all beings is the natural expression of one who is spiritually awakened. To be an instrument of God’s love in all that we do is an essential practice and the goal of yoga. In Yoga and Veganism, Sharon Gannon shares the treasures of her own compassionate heart, and her lifetime of study and practice. In doing so, she helps us to connect with our own hearts and the hearts of all life-loving beings. I am sincerely grateful to Sharon for her genuine kindness and for this illuminating book.”</strong> </p> <p> —H. H. Radhanath Swami, spiritual leader, activist, and best-selling author of The Journey Home: Autobiography of an American Swami and The Journey Within: Exploring the Path of Bhakti </p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> “Yoga means connection, but yoga is much more than uniting with one’s physical body. Through bhakti yoga, loving devotion to God, a soulful bond is established with the Divine presence. Entering into such a relationship with the Supreme requires a body, mind, and heart that has been purified and is maintained through a sattvic vegan diet. As described in this book, veganism will bring the practitioner closer to mukti, that state of eternal bliss and total love.”</strong> </p> <p> —Shri Milan Goswami, spiritual leader, direct descendant and lineage holder of the Pushti Marg (Path of Grace) Sampradaya of Vallabhacharya </p> <p> </p> <span> </span> <p> Jivamukti Yoga</p> <p> <span> [email protected]</span> <br/> © 2020 Jivamukti Yoga</p> <p> Let&#8217;s be friends!</p> <br/> <span> Facebook</span> <br/> <br/> <span> Instagram</span> <br/> <br/> <span> Twitter</span> <br/> <br/> <span> Pinterest</span> <br/> <h3> Welcome to Our Community</h3> <p> Quick Links</p> Contact us All Jivamukti Yoga Classes All Jivamukti Yoga Teachers Focus of the month Register Your Yoga Studio Press Photos News Teacher Admin <span> </span> <p> Legal Links</p> Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Website Accessibility Statement <span> </span> <h2> </h2> <h3> STAY UP TO DATE</h3> <p> <h3> Welcome to Our Community</h3> </p> &times; <span> </span><br>
